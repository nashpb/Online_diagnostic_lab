        <p>
            I was delighted with the treatment. Despite me being a somewhat difficult patient Dr. Matsatsi was really
            gentle, patient and understanding.
            The treatment was explained precisely to me and the price was quoted right at the beginning which is exactly
            what the price was at the end.
            The transformation to my life in general has been amazing.
            I am extremely happy with the quality of the treatment.
